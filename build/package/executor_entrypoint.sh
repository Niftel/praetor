# NOTE: the executor does NOT stage a shared SSH private key into its home. Each
# job's connection key comes from its Machine credential, resolved at dispatch and
# written to a per-run ephemeral file (/tmp/cred-key-<run_id>, removed after the
# run) — see services/executor/core/bootstrap_runner.go. A job with no Machine
# credential is rejected, so there is no default-identity fallback to stage here.
# Keeping the key out of the container's home shrinks the key-exposure surface.

# SSH host-key policy: trust-on-first-use. accept-new records an unknown host's
# key on first connect but REJECTS a changed key thereafter (MITM protection),
# and known_hosts lives on the persisted praetor-ssh volume so trust survives
# restarts. (Previously StrictHostKeyChecking=no + UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
# disabled verification entirely, defeating that volume.)
